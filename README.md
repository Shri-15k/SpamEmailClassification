# **Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning algorithms. The system is designed to automatically identify spam emails, enhancing user productivity and email security.

## **Features**
- Preprocesses email text using tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming.
- Extracts features using the TF-IDF vectorizer.
- Implements and compares multiple classification models, including:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression


## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Platform**: Google Colab  

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the models is sourced from Kaggle:  
[Spam Emails Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/spam-emails)
